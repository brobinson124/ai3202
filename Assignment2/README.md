# Assignment2
Repo for my second assignment for Intro to Artificial Intelligence

My heuristic was the pythagorean theorem because it was a good over-estimate of the value it would take to get to the goal. It requires the equations: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This was an over-evaluation because I never took the square root of my a^2 + b^2, so this straight line estimate must be an over-evaluation. 

I couldn't get it to work, so I am not sure it is better or worse.
