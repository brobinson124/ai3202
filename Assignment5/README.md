My assignment uses my A* solution as a base.

I have tried several different values for my epsilon. There are no values within 0<e<=9 that change
the path. I believe this is due to the negative rewards of the snakes in other parts of the world. 

I tried the following values:

0.0000001,
0.001,
0.01,
0.1,
0.5,
0.9,
0.900001,
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
7,
8,
9,
9.000001
